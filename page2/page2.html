         <p id="review1"> Normal People" is a poignant and beautifully
              written novel that delves into<br> the intricacies of human
               connection and the transformative power of love.<br> Set in 
               contemporary Ireland, the story follows the lives of two
                main<br> characters, Marianne and Connell, as they navigate
                 the challenges<br> of adolescence and young adulthood.
             The narrative is a powerful<br> exploration of the class divide
              and social hierarchy, as Marianne<br> and Connell come from 
              very different backgrounds. Connell is<br> popular, well-liked,
               and comes from a working-class family, while<br> Marianne is 
               a highly intelligent but socially ostracized young woman<br> 
               from a wealthy family. Their complex relationship, which 
               begins in<br> high school, evolves throughout the years, reflecting
                the ebb and <br>flow of their personal growth, desires, and insecurities.

                 <p id="review2"> 
                     "After Dark" is a novel by Haruki Murakami that takes place during<br> the late hours of
                      the night and early morning in Tokyo. The story<br> revolves around several characters 
                      and their encounters during<br> this time. It's a somewhat surreal and atmospheric book
                       that<br> explores themes of isolation,loneliness, and the mysteries of the<br> night.The
                        book's use of jazz music is a recurring motif, adding<br> to the overall ambiance of the story.
                         It highlights the idea that <br>in the stillness of the night, people can explore their innermost<br>
                          thoughts and emotions, much like a jazz musician improvising<br> on their instrument.
                       "After Dark" is a relatively short novel,<br> and it can be read in one sitting, which adds
                        to the immersive quality<br> of the story. However, some readers may find that the open-ended <br>
                        conclusion leaves them with unanswered questions and a desire for<br> more closure.

     <p id="review3"> 
         "Readers are drawn to this novel for its relatable and well-developed characters,<br> the evocative
          descriptions of Tokyo and the human psyche, and its exploration of<br> themes like loneliness and
           the quest for meaning in a world that often feels disconnected.<br>
         While some may find the book's melancholic tone and exploration of mental health<br> challenging, 
         others appreciate its depth and the raw, honest way it tackles these themes.<br> "Norwegian Wood" is
          a book that lingers in the reader's mind, evoking a sense of nostalgia <br>and introspection long 
          after the last page is turned.
